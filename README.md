Hey friend. I made this `README.md` just for you.

Line 19 of `index.html` loads a style sheet that controls the color scheme. If you click on the link to the style sheet and search for the term `palette-turquoise`, it shows you the hex of that teal color that's everywhere. There seems to be several other palettes, although maybe I'm misunderstanding the meaning of a palette. I just want to be able to change the color scheme without manually going in and changing all instances of `#1abc9c` to some other color and also figuring out which hex corresponds to the slightly different shades of teal (like when you hover over a button) so I can assign a different shade of another color, etc..

Tell me if that makes sense or if I'm misunderstanding what a palette means in this context (which is sorta what I think is happening here).

I also downloaded the style sheet so I can edit it if you want to play around with that. Just comment out line 19 and uncomment line 20 and you can edit the file `flat-ui.min.css` to see how it changes things.


To change color scheme: update the variables in `css/style.css` file.
